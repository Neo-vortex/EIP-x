##DRAFT CODE!

This Rust code is designed based on RLPX communication protocol to interact with Ethereum nodes using the Ethereum Node Discovery Protocol (Discv5). It aims to discover Ethereum nodes, send FINDNODE requests, and includes the ability to append Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) messages to these requests.

Features
Node Discovery: The code establishes connections with Ethereum nodes and sends FINDNODE requests to discover peers.

ZKP Integration: It allows you to include ZKP messages in FINDNODE requests. ZKP messages can be retrieved from Helios nodes.

Configuration: The code is configurable with options such as local ENR setup, bootnodes, and request parameters.
30-oc-2023: 
implemented a loop that periodically sends FINDNODE requests to the connected nodes.adjusted the sleep duration to 10 milliseconds, you can use the tokio library, which provides more fine-grained control over asynchronous tasks and timers

Possible modifications needed for flashbots: 
In the context of Flashbots, a protocol designed to address the issue of MEV  in Ethereum transactions, this Rust code could be adapted for a unique use case. It could facilitate communication with Flashbots relay services.

1. **Adaptation:**
   - Modify the `main` function to include Flashbots relay services in the list of connected nodes.
   - Adjust the `NodeRecord` instances to represent Flashbots relay node information.

2. **Enhancement:**
   - Extend the `send_findnode_request` function to include a Flashbots-specific message or request format.
   - Incorporate Flashbots-specific data in the payload, such as transaction bundles with MEV instructions.

3. **Execution:**
   - Use the adapted code to asynchronously communicate with Flashbots relay services.
   - Send requests for transaction bundles, including relevant MEV details, to Flashbots nodes.

4. **Response Handling:**
   - Modify the logic to handle Flashbots-specific responses, considering success, errors, or additional instructions received from the relay services.
  
   - notable use cases: 
	Transaction Prioritization:
	•	By adapting the code, users can prioritize transactions based on Flashbots relay information. The system can selectively submit transactions to Flashbots for inclusion in specific blocks, optimizing the chances of favorable execution.
	Dynamic MEV Strategies:
	•	The code can be employed to dynamically adjust MEV strategies based on real-time information from Flashbots. This includes adapting to changes in the Ethereum mempool and adjusting transaction parameters for maximum profitability.
Custom Transaction Batching:
	•	Utilize the code to create a system that intelligently batches transactions for submission to Flashbots. This can include grouping transactions based on similarity or optimizing for specific MEV opportunities.
